Tests to be done -

EASY -
Basic Parallel Sum: Divide a large array into chunks and calculate the sum of each chunk concurrently using multiple threads.
-> Compare the total execution time with a single-threaded approach.

Thread Sleep and Wakeup: Measure the time it takes for a thread to sleep for a short duration and then wake up.
-> This benchmark assesses the overhead of thread context switching and scheduling.

Thread Join Overhead: Create multiple threads that perform simple tasks and then join them sequentially.
-> Measure the time taken for each thread to complete and the total overhead of joining threads.

Incrementing a Shared Counter: Have multiple threads increment a shared counter a large number of times concurrently.
-> Compare the final value of the counter with the expected value to evaluate thread safety and synchronization overhead.

Basic Producer-Consumer: Create a simple producer-consumer scenario where one thread produces data items and another thread consumes them.
-> Measure the throughput and latency of data transfer between threads.

Thread Creation vs. Task Execution: Compare the time it takes to create a thread with the time taken to execute a simple task in a thread.
-> This benchmark helps assess the overhead of thread creation versus the actual work performed by threads.

Simple Parallel Loop: Parallelize a basic loop that iterates over a large number of iterations using multiple threads.
-> Measure the time taken to complete the loop in parallel versus sequentially.

Thread Termination Overhead: Create threads that perform a simple task and then terminate immediately.
-> Measure the time taken for a thread to terminate after completing its task.

----------

MEDIUM -

Thread Creation Overhead: Measure the time it takes to create and start a large number of threads concurrently.
-> This benchmark helps assess the overhead of thread creation in different languages.

Basic Task Parallelism: Create a simple parallel task, such as calculating the sum of a large array or performing a repetitive computation.
-> Compare the execution time when running the task concurrently using multiple threads.

Thread Coordination: Implement a scenario where multiple threads need to coordinate their actions, such as updating a shared counter or performing a barrier synchronization.
-> Measure the overhead and efficiency of thread coordination mechanisms like locks, mutexes, or semaphores.

Parallelized I/O Operations: Write a program that performs concurrent I/O operations, such as reading from or writing to multiple files simultaneously.
-> Measure the throughput and latency of I/O-bound tasks across languages.

CPU-bound vs. I/O-bound Workloads: Design benchmarks that differentiate between CPU-bound and I/O-bound workloads.
-> Compare the performance of languages in handling CPU-intensive tasks (e.g., mathematical calculations) versus I/O-bound tasks (e.g., file I/O or network operations) using multithreading.

Thread Pool Performance: Implement a thread pool and submit tasks to be executed concurrently.
-> Measure the overhead of task scheduling, thread creation, and resource management in maintaining the thread pool.

Concurrency Control Overhead: Evaluate the overhead of synchronization primitives like locks or mutexes by measuring the time taken to acquire and release them in a multithreaded environment.

Scalability Testing: Gradually increase the number of threads or tasks in a benchmark and observe how performance scales with increasing concurrency.
-> Identify any bottlenecks or limitations in scalability across languages.

HARD -

Parallelized Matrix Multiplication: Implement matrix multiplication using multithreading in different languages and measure the execution time.
-> This benchmark tests the efficiency of parallelization and thread management.

Parallelized Sorting Algorithms: Implement parallel versions of sorting algorithms like quicksort or mergesort and compare their performance across languages.
-> Sorting large datasets in parallel can highlight differences in multithreading capabilities.

Producer-Consumer Problem: Create a scenario where multiple producer threads generate data items, which are consumed by consumer threads. Measure throughput and latency across languages to assess the efficiency of concurrent data processing.

Parallel File Processing: Design a benchmark where multiple threads read and process data from files concurrently.
-> Measure throughput and scalability across languages, considering factors like disk I/O and CPU utilization.

Parallel HTTP Requests: Write a program to perform parallel HTTP requests to multiple endpoints simultaneously.
-> Measure response times and throughput to evaluate the efficiency of multithreading in handling network-related tasks.

Parallel Image Processing: Develop an image processing application that applies filters or transformations to images using multithreading. Measure the time taken to process a batch of images concurrently in different languages.

Monte Carlo Simulation: Implement a Monte Carlo simulation that calculates pi or simulates a financial model using multithreading.
-> Compare the execution time and accuracy of results across languages.

Concurrency with Data Structures: Test the performance of concurrent data structures like queues, maps, or sets in different languages under heavy concurrent access scenarios.
-> Measure throughput, scalability, and synchronization overhead.
